Qubit (Quantum Bit) - What Is It?
A qubit (quantum bit) is the fundamental unit used for storing and processing information in quantum computers. Unlike classical computers, where bits are the fundamental units, qubits rely on the principles of quantum mechanics. A qubit is a system that, according to the principles of quantum mechanics, can simultaneously exist in both the 0 and 1 states. This means that, unlike classical bits, qubits can be in a state called superposition. Qubits also possess another feature known as quantum entanglement. When two qubits are entangled quantum mechanically, the state of one can affect the state of the other, and this entanglement can persist over any distance under certain conditions. This can be utilized for quantum information transfer or cryptography between qubits. Another feature of qubits is the preservation of quantum states and uncertainty in measurement. Before measuring whether a qubit is in a certain state, it can be in superposition, and its exact state may be uncertain. However, upon measurement, the state of the qubit is determined and observed as either 0 or 1. These characteristics distinguish qubits from classical bits and enable quantum computers to harness parallel computation capabilities and operate certain algorithms faster. Therefore, qubits can possess computational power and processing capabilities beyond what classical computers can achieve.
