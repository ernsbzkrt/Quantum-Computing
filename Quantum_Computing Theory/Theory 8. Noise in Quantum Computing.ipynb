        "One of the major challenges faced by quantum computers, the concept of \"noise,\" can be defined as unwanted interactions and errors stemming from various external influences. These interactions lead to changes in quantum states, consequently causing computational errors. Quantum noise models represent theoretical frameworks aimed at understanding these noise sources and effects. These models are utilized to examine the impact of noise on the accuracy of quantum computations and to develop techniques to mitigate these effects."
