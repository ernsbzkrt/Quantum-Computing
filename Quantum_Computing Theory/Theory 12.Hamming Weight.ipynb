        "\n",
        "The Hamming weight is a term used in fields such as digital communication and computer science. Essentially, it denotes the number of ones in the binary representation of a number. In other words, it indicates how many '1' bits there are in a bit sequence. The concept of Hamming weight is related to the Hamming distance; while Hamming distance measures the number of differing positions between two sequences, Hamming weight measures the number of ones in a single sequence."
