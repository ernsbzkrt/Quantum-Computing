        "\n",
        "This theorem takes its name from the Bell Theorems proposed by John Stewart Bell in 1964. These theorems mathematically demonstrate that the predictions of quantum mechanics cannot be explained by local hidden variable theories. Local hidden variable theories assume that the properties of particles (such as spin, polarization) are predetermined before any measurement is made, and that these properties are determined by local interactions regardless of the distance between particles. Bell's work highlights a fundamental aspect of quantum entanglement and underscores how different quantum mechanics is from classical physics.\n"

        "* Local hidden variables represent an alternative theory in quantum mechanics. This theory suggests that the properties of quantum systems (such as the spin state of an electron or the polarization of a photon, for example) are predetermined, and these properties can be revealed through an external measurement. In other words, a particle's specific property already has a value that exists independently of its measurement. This approach aims to explain the uncertainty and probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics with \"hidden\" variables that are unknown but in principle knowable. The term \"local\" emphasizes the idea that these hidden variables must adhere to the speed-of-light limit specified in Albert Einstein's special theory of relativity, meaning that information or effect must be transmitted from one point to another at a maximum speed of light. Thus, any interaction or information transfer within a system is \"local\" within the constraints of these limitations.\n",
        "\n",
        "* The Bell theorems demonstrated that local hidden variable theories are incompatible with certain experimental results predicted by quantum mechanics. Bell's work, supported by experiments showing that quantum entanglement is real and that the properties of quantum particles cannot be explained by predetermined local variables, reinforces the principle of uncertainty, one of the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics. This underscores how fundamentally different the quantum world is from our classical understanding of physics.\n",

        "Quantum entanglement is a quantum mechanical phenomenon where the states of two or more particles are correlated regardless of the distance between them. The Bell State, confirmed by experiments showing that measurements of entangled particle pairs exhibit statistical correlations independent of the distance between the particles, has been verified. Violation of Bell inequalities indicates that measurements of entangled particles can instantaneously influence each other without the need for information or interaction to be transmitted between the particles. This is a feature that Einstein referred to as \"spooky action at a distance\" and disliked because it contradicts the principle of nothing can move faster than the speed of light, a fundamental principle of his theory of relativity.\n",

        "Bell experiments can be performed using photons, electrons, or other quantum particles. In these experiments, entangled particles are typically sent in different directions, and the properties of each particle (such as the direction of polarization) are measured independently. While Bell inequalities predict that the outcomes of these measurements should adhere to a certain limit, quantum mechanics suggests that this limit can be exceeded. Conducted experiments have consistently favored the predictions of quantum mechanics and provided a strong argument against local hidden variable theories.\n"
