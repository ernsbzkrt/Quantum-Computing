        "Quantum information channels are information transmission systems based on the principles of quantum mechanics. Unlike traditional information transmission systems, quantum information channels transmit and process quantum states.\n",
        "\n",
        "A quantum information channel is typically designed as a physical system that transmits a quantum state. Quantum states, replacing the classical bits used in classical information transfer, are called quantum bits or \"qubits.\" Unlike classical bits, qubits have the ability to exist in both 0 and 1 simultaneously, enabling parallel processing. This potential for parallelism can lead to increased speed and efficiency in quantum information processing and transmission.\n",
        "\n",
        "Quantum information channels can utilize various quantum mechanical phenomena to enable the transmission, processing, and reception of quantum states. Among these phenomena are photonic quantum states for quantum telecommunication (e.g., quantum key distribution), nuclear magnetism for quantum information processing (e.g., nuclear magnetic resonance), and concepts like quantum entanglement for quantum entanglement.\n",
        "\n",
        "Quantum information channels have significant applications in areas such as quantum information processing, quantum communication, and quantum computing. They are particularly used to develop secure and fast communication protocols such as quantum encryption, quantum key distribution, and quantum teleportation.\n",

The expression `np.sqrt(0.9) * np.array([[1, 0],[0, 1]])` matches with the scaled version of the identity matrix by √0.9.

This type of error alters the state of a qubit. For example, a qubit in the state 0 can flip to 1 due to an error, or vice versa.\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Finally, an object from the `Kraus` class is instantiated, and the `noise_ops` list is passed as a parameter to it. The `Kraus` class is a commonly used structure in a QEC model or noise modeling. Kraus operators are matrices representing possible error types on a qubit. These errors can affect the superposition states and correlations of qubits.\n",
