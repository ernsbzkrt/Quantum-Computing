# Quantum Information

This repository aims to discuss the topic of Quantum Information using Qiskit and covers the following topics:

## Topics to be Covered

1. **Quantum Information States**: These are the states or vectors used to describe quantum systems. A quantum system may involve superpositions of these states for one or more qubits.

2. **Quantum Information Operators**: These are matrices that operate on quantum states. These operators can change, transform, or analyze quantum states. Examples include operators like Hadamard, Pauli, and CNOT.

3. **Quantum Information Channels**: These are tools that enable the transmission of quantum information from one point to another. These channels can be used to transmit, store, or process quantum states, playing a significant role in quantum information processing tasks.
   
4. **Quantum Information Measures**: These are criteria used to measure or evaluate the properties of a quantum system. These measures can be used to assess the purity, uncertainty, or other characteristics of a quantum state.

## Workflow

This section will discuss theoretical concepts and perform various operations using Quantum Information and Algorithms.
